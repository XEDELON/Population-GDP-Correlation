# World Population and GDP Analysis 📊

This project analyzes the relationship between **world population** and **GDP per capita** over the years 1960–2021.

✅ We:
- Gathered datasets from Kaggle on population and GDP per capita.
- Cleaned and tidied the data (handled missing values, unified formats, reshaped from wide to long).
- Removed outliers separately for each country to avoid distortion.
- Merged the datasets for unified analysis.
- Explored the data visually (scatter plots, line charts, heatmaps) to uncover insights.

### 📌 Project questions explored
- How population growth correlates with GDP growth in specific countries.
- Trends in GDP per capita over decades.
- Outlier impacts on our analysis.
